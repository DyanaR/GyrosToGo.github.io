# Restaurant Website

My uncle owns a restaurant that has an oudated website (http://www.gyrostogo1.com/). Therefore, I decided to update it in to a modern styled website to implent the skills I have been learning. This was a fun experience bringing life to the website. Customers will be able to navigate easily and quicly through the website with great readability, from reading the menu to finding a near location. 


I learned to implement HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT making me well versed in them. I had difficulty with the functionality of the form. However, after mulitple tries with php and rigorous Google searches, I decided to embed Formspree into my html. 


You can view my website through this link https://dyanar.github.io/GyrosToGo.github.io/index.html. This link is not accessible to customers, it is only for the purpose of presenting my project. I am working on hosting the website on my uncle's existing domain.
