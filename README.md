I updated a local restaurant website that is outdated into an modern styled website to implent the skills I have been learning. This was a fun experience bringing life to the website. Customers will be able to navigate easily and quicly through the website with great readability, from reading the menu to finding a near location. I learned to implement HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT making me well versed in them.
