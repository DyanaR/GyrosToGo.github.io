I updated a local restaurant [website](http://www.gyrostogo1.com/) that is outdated into an modern styled website to implent the skills I have been learning. This was a fun experience bringing life to the website. Customers will be able to navigate easily and quickly through the website with great readability, from reading the menu to finding a near location. I used HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript to build the functional website. Moreover, I implemented Node.JS and Express to allow functionality to the contact form on the careers page.
